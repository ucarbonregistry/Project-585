Chargeup Solution

The Chargeup Solution project is a multi-site clean mobility initiative implemented by E-Chargeup Solutions Pvt. Ltd. across multiple cities in India. The project involves the deployment and operation of 4,245 electric three-wheelers for last-mile passenger transport, supported by an innovative Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) model. By replacing conventional petrol-based auto-rickshaws, the project significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves urban air quality, and lowers operating costs for drivers. The project applies AMS-III.C methodology and is expected to achieve total emission reductions of approximately 21,531 tCO₂e over crediting period, while also delivering strong social and economic co-benefits.

______________
The project, titled "Chargeup Solution", is a multi-site GHG mitigation project activity. It is not
located in a single village or tehsil but operates across a wide geographical area in Northern India,
including the following states and cities including Delhi (NCR), Uttar Pradesh (Ghaziabad, Noida,
Agra, Mathura, Aligarh, Lucknow), Haryana (Faridabad, Gurgaon, Panipat, Sonipat, Karnal),
Rajasthan (Jaipur), Madhya Pradesh (Gwalior) and Punjab (Ludhiana)

Purpose of the project activity:

The project is implemented by E-Chargeup Solutions Pvt Ltd. The core activity involves the current
deployment and operation of 4,245 new L5-category electric three-wheelers (e-rickshaws) for lastmile passenger transport. This fleet is supported by the company's comprehensive "Battery as a Service" (BaaS) model, which includes a network of battery Financing and asset management, vehicle
financing, and asset management.

The project directly reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by replacing the baseline technology:
conventional 3-wheeled auto-rickshaws. Based on the project's verified calculation sheet, the baseline
vehicles, run on petrol. The project avoids the tailpipe emissions from the combustion of this petrol,
which would have occurred in the absence of the project.

The project is positive for the environment and contributes to sustainable development by:

● Reducing GHG Emissions: Directly mitigating climate change by replacing fossil-fuelburning vehicles with zero-tailpipe-emission electric vehicles.

● Improving Air Quality: Eliminating localized air pollution (PM2.5, NOx, SOx) in dense
urban environments across multiple states.

● Empowering Drivers: The project's BaaS model increases driver uptime and daily net
earnings by reducing operational and refuelling costs.

● Supporting SDGs: The project is in strong alignment with the UN Sustainable Development
Goals, including SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic
Growth), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

The “Chargeup Solution” project employs advanced electric mobility technology to displace fossil
fuel consumption from conventional petrol and CNG-based three-wheelers used in last-mile
transportation. The project involves the large-scale deployment of Electric 3-Wheelers (E3Ws)
powered by Lithium-Ion (LFP/NMC) battery packs integrated with an IoT-based monitoring system
for operational efficiency, driver management, and real-time emission tracking.

1. Technology Description and System Working

Each E3W is powered by a lithium-ion battery pack that supplies energy to a high-efficiency brushless
DC motor through a smart motor controller. The stored electrical energy is drawn from the state
electricity grid via plug-in charging.
The Battery Management System (BMS) within each battery pack ensures optimal cell voltage, temperature control, and state-of-charge management to prevent overcharging, overheating, and
short-circuiting. Real-time data from the BMS is transmitted via an IoT telematics module to
Chargeup’s central digital platform, which records vehicle performance, trip data, and charging cycles
for monitoring and reporting purposes.
The project operates under the “Fi-Ne-Tech” (Finance–Network–Technology) model developed by
E-Chargeup Solutions Pvt. Ltd., integrating financing, technology, and driver networks into a unified
ecosystem. Through this model, EV ownership is made affordable, operations are monitored digitally,
and uptime is maximized through predictive maintenance.

2. Process Flow (Cradle-to-Grave Overview)

1. Vehicle Procurement & Financing:

o Drivers are onboarded through partner NBFCs or Chargeup’s in-house financing
scheme.

o Vehicles and battery packs are procured from approved OEMs and certified
manufacturers.

2. Deployment & Operation:

o Electric 3-wheelers are deployed in multiple cities across Northern India for
passenger and goods transport.

o Daily operations involve battery charging/Distribution network and trip logging
through the IoT platform.

3. Energy Source:

o Electricity sourced from the state grid (renewable and non-renewable mix).

o The system design allows future integration with renewable (solar) charging
infrastructure.

4. Monitoring & Maintenance:

o IoT-connected systems record energy usage, distance travelled, charging frequency,
and downtime.

o Predictive maintenance alerts ensure high uptime and safety.

5. End of Life Management:

o Batteries reaching end-of-life are recovered through authorized recyclers under
India’s Battery Waste Management Rules (2022) to ensure safe material recovery
and environmental compliance.
